            <p>It's hard for him not to eat. Doctors say he is overweight, but he is happy. That's all that matters to
                him and us :)</p>

            The American Bully breed was established in the mid-1990s with the purpose of creating the ultimate family
            companion. The American Bully was created through years of selective breeding by combining the desired
            traits of the UKC American Pit Bull Terrier and the AKC American Staffordshire Terrier. BARK BARK BARK BARK
