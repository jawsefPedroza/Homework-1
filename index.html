            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I have multiple hobbies. I like to go for walks, play video games, listen to music, talk to my dog, <a href="Mason.html">Mason the Dog</a>, and hang out with friends to do anything besides rot in my room all day.</p>

            <h4><em>Video Games:</em></h4>
            <p>I am a huge advocate for gaming, and some of my favorite games that I play and would recommend are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Star Wars: The Force Awakens - This game has a fundamental freedom and, to me, it is the best Star Wars game where you play as a powerful Sith and have full control of the force.</li>
                <li>Skate 3 - I am really into skate culture, and this game brings a lot of it from design to skateable maps, fun arcade style of unrealistic skating but realistic in the sense where you have to flip your joystick to do a trick instead of buttons. One of the best soundtracks and playlists of all time to a point where I put myself onto multiple artists like Pixies and Joy Division.</li>
                <li><b><i>Halo Combat Evolved</i></b> - This is my favorite game of all time. I have played it around 20 times already and one of the first games I have ever played, the story, combat, level design, soundtrack to how the enemies interact with the world and your play style is different from anything I have ever played. To me, this game is a masterpiece and my childhood.</li>
                <li>Red Dead Redemption 2 - One of the few games I have cried to and been so engaged from the characters long. It's such a beautiful and visually stunning game. The NPCs are all unique, and the map is so big that you can get lost doing side missions or your own thing.</li>
                <li>Resident Evil 4 - With its over-the-shoulder camera and precision aiming, Resident Evil 4 revolutionized not only survival horror but the shooter genre as a whole.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>My Music Taste</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Why I am so into music</summary>
          <p>Mostly when it comes to music I am into grunge, nu metal, hip-hop/rap, Jazz, shoegaze. To me music is a form of poetry and shouldn't always be interpreted about what the musician is talking about but how they feel. To me music is a way to leave the world and join a fantasy for relaxation and to feel vulnerable but not judge. Artists like Nirvana, Joy Division, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Soundgarden help shape the way I dress, act and express myself. </p>

                                <pre>
                                    In nattle, in forest, at the precipice in the moutains,
                                 
                                    On the dark great sea, in the midst of javelins and arrows,
                                 
                                    In sleep, in confusion, in the depths of shame,
                                    
                                    The good deeds a man has done before defend him.
                                 </pre>
