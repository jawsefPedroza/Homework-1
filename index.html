            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I have multiple hobbies. I like to go for walks, play video games, listen to music, talk to my dog, <a href="Mason.html">Mason the Dog</a>, and hang out with friends to do anything besides rot in my room all day.</p>

            <h4><em>Video Games:</em></h4>
            <p>I am a huge advocate for gaming, and some of my favorite games that I play and would recommend are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</li>
                <li>Skate 3</li>
                <li><b><i>Halo Combat Evolved</i></b></li>

        <h2>My Music Taste</h2>

        <details>
          <summary>Why I am so into music</summary>
          <p>Mostly when it comes to music I am into grunge, nu metal, hip-hop/rap, Jazz, shoegaze. To me music is a form of poetry and shouldn't always be interpreted about what the musician is talking about but how they feel. To me music is a way to leave the world and join a fantasy for relaxation and to feel vulnerable but not judge. Artists like Nirvana, Joy Division, Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Soundgarden help shape the way I dress, act and express myself. </p>
